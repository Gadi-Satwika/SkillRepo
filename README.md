# SkillRepo 🎯

SkillRepo is a responsive multi-page front-end web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and enhanced with **Sass (SCSS)** in the final task. It showcases a variety of UI features like pagination, bookmarking, responsive layouts, interactive buttons, and API integration — demonstrating my learning journey and growing expertise in modern front-end development.
